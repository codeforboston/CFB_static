<h1 class="t-section-headline">Welcome to Open Savannah!</h1>

<p>The best way to dive into the Open Savannah community is to join us at our <a href="{{site.meetup_url}}">monthly Second Thursday night meetups</a>. Here are a few things to do if you're new to our community.</p>

<ol class="walkthrough-list">
    <li>
        <h2>Get set up with Slack</h2>
        <p>We use <a href="https://bit.ly/opensav-slack">slack</a> to keep in touch when we aren't hanging out in person. We also track ongoing conversations, research, and project development there. Once you're in Slack, feel free to say hi in our #general channel and maybe tell everyone what makes you excited about civic tech or how you'd prefer to get involved.</p>
	<a href="{{site.slack_url}}" class="btn-secondary btn--large">Join our Slack community</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Join Github (even if you don't code!)</h2>
	<p>We use <a href="{{site.gitup_url}}">github</a> to share and work on code-related projects. Many of our projects center around technology and therefore involve code, but you don't need to be able to write code to get involved! Github offers a range of ways to be part of the development process such as assisting in writing documentation or helping project managers keep track of work to be done.</p>
