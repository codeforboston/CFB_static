<h1 class="t-section-headline">Welcome to Open Savannah!</h1>

<p>The best way to dive into the Open Savannah community is to join us at our <a href="{{site.meetup_url}}">monthly Second Thursday night meetups</a>. Here are a few things to do if you're new to our community.</p>

<ol class="walkthrough-list">
    <li>
        <h2>RSVP for Kickoff Event</h2>
	<p>Don't miss our kickoff event Thurs. Feb. 23 at Bull Street Labs, where we'll be having a community brainstorming session, deciding on our first brigade civic tech project and doing a short collaborative exercise to build an app that helps residents find the contact information for their neighborhood association presidents. Go ahead and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/OpenSavannah/events/237184321/">RSVP to save your spot</a></p>

    <li>
        <h2>Get set up with Slack</h2>
        <p>We use <a href="https://techsav.co/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation">slack</a> to keep in touch when we aren't hanging out in person, which we share with <a href="http://techsav.co">techSAV</a>. We also track ongoing conversations, research, and project development there. Once you're in Slack, make sure to join the `#opensavannah` channel, feel free to say hi in techSAV's #general channel and maybe tell everyone what makes you excited about civic tech or how you'd prefer to get involved.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Join Github (even if you don't code!)</h2>
	<p>We use <a href="{{site.gitup_url}}">github</a> to share and work on code-related projects. Many of our projects center around technology and therefore involve code, but you don't need to be able to write code to get involved! Github offers a range of ways to be part of the development process such as assisting in writing documentation or helping project managers keep track of work to be done.</p>

        <h2>Follow along on Hackpad</h2>
	<p>We use <a href="https://hackpad.com/collection/EMu2jCE4Bv1">Hackpad</a> for our bi-weekly updates. If you can't make it to our <a href="{{site.meetup_url}}">bi-monthly meetings</a>, you can always stay informed by checking out the latest weekly update.</p>
