  <p>The <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-of-civic-hacking-2017">National Day of Civic Hacking</a> brings together people who care about their communities to tackle big problems. This year's theme is "local" - which means that we're looking for Bostonians to bring their concerns and ideas about our own city on <b>September 23rd</b>.</p>

  <h2>FAQs</h2>
  <h4>Who can participate in the NDoCH?</h4>
  <p>Anyone and everyone can participate! Typically, we see a mix of interests and skills represented, including those who work in technology like developers, designers, and data scientists, and those who are engaged in civic life, like journalists and community activists.</p>
  <h4>What kinds of projects are a good fit for NDoCH?</h4>
  <p>We've got some tips on how to frame a project proposal <a href="/projects">here.</a> Last year's event explored issues around housing, transportation, open data, and the environment, together with the state IT department MassIT.</p>
  <h4>What does "hacking" mean, anyway?</h4>
  <p>Good question! To us, hacking doesn't just mean coding (our name notwithstanding). It means the whole process of making something that changes how the world works. It also means an ethos of scrappiness, creativity, and drive. Civic hackers are people who use whatever they have on hand - tools, skills, knowledge, relationships - to make things that improve civic life. If that sounds like you, you are welcome here.</p>
